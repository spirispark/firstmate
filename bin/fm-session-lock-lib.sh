# Walk the current process ancestry (up to 16 hops) and print a harness identity.
# For every harness except Claude, the first match wins (innermost pid), which
# is where e.g. Pi's shared signed-wrapper ancestry actually holds the session:
# a "pi-signed" launcher can be the direct parent of the inner "pi" engine
# pid that owns the lock, and the wrapper pid above it is not that owner.
# Claude Code's bg-spare hook worker chain is the opposite shape: it nests
# several claude-named processes directly parent-child with no non-harness
# process between them, and the lock is held by the outermost pid of that
# run. So once a claude-named match is found, this keeps walking past it
# looking for a still-more-ancestral claude-named match, and stops the
# instant a non-match follows - never walking past that gap to an unrelated
# claude-named process further up the real process tree (e.g. the live
# session that launched a test as its own subprocess). The harness pid lives
# as long as the session, unlike the transient subshell pid of any one tool
# call. Codex 0.146.0 can deny `ps` inside its seatbelt; when that happens,
# fall back to Codex's verified per-thread marker and publish a codex-thread
# identity instead of a numeric pid.
